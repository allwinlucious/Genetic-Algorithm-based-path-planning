# Genetic-Algorithm-based-path-planning
Work done for bachelor thesis at IIT Bhubaneswar. 

Genetic Algorithm was used to plan the path of a 3dof robot arm avoiding collisons with its body and with obstacles in the workspace.
GJK algorithm was used to find collisions in the 3D space

this was then added to plan the path of two-3dof arms of a mobile robot.
